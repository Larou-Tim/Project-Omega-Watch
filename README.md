# Project-Omega-Watch

## 1. What problem is there?
	Have you ever wanted to be the best?
	Have you ever wanted a pokemon themed website? The pokemon have many interesting color themes!

## 2. how does our app address/solve this.
	Our app lets you search for any pokemon and see the colors that make up the sprite.
	Then you can take those colors and see how they look on a sample page.
	If you like what you see you can download the theme you tried out.

## 3. what steps take to build this
	Michael worked on building a nice looking front end product.
	Kyle built logins and a database.
	Tim built the backend to search for pokemon and pull what colors make that pokemon image.

## 4. Show the app running
	See the website live @ htpps://project-omega-watch.firebaseapp.com
		
## 5. What features would we like to add
	The ability to save a color profile to the database.
